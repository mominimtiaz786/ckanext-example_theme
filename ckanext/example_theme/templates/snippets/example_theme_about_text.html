        Open Data Pakistan is one standardized platform that aims to create a culture of sharing data in Pakistan within every sector, public and private. A major goal is to have all datasets of Pakistan on this portal; therefore, it is crucial for different institutions to sign up and publish data and visualizations. This open data portal can be used as a tool to disseminate raw data and information. The portal also aims to help unlock the value of data by being able to analyze it in machine-readable and open formats.
